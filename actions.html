    <h2>FR3E Requests Annulment of AML6, AMLA and AMLD</h2>
    <p><br>Paris, July 15th 2024</p>
    <p class="quote"><br>“Contracting States [do not] enjoy an unlimited discretion to subject persons within their jurisdiction to secret surveillance. The Court, being aware of the danger such a law poses of undermining or even destroying democracy on the ground of defending it, affirms that the Contracting States may not, in the name of the struggle against espionage and terrorism, adopt whatever measures they deem appropriate.”</p>
    <p class="caption"><br>ECtHR, case of Klass and others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, 49.</p>
    <p><br>Today we are announcing a pan-european coopertion between FR3E (FR), Human Rights in Finance (NL), XXX, and XXX to request the annulment of the EU's latest AML package, consisting of AML6, AMLA and AMLD published in the Official Journal of the European Union on May 19th.</p>
    <p><br>According to the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights (EUCFR), which has the same meaning and scope than the European Convention on Human Rights for rights that are protected in both texts, acts of the EU must be necessary and proportionate where they limit rights and freedoms. In order to reach such objective, competent authorities should perform a privacy impact assessement, which corresponds to the state of the art since it enables to identify arbitrary limits to freedoms, notably in assessing the added value of new legislation in light of the preceeding one, backed up by evidence of practical effectiveness.</p>
    <p><br>This circumstance has been taken into account in an interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament, Council and Commission on better law-making, based on Article 295 of the Treaty on European Union: in this agreement, institutions declare “that public and stakeholder consultation, ex-post evaluation of existing legislation and impact assessments of new initiatives will help achieve the objective of Better Law-Making”. They moreover agree to “legislate only where and to the extent necessary, in accordance with Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union on the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality”.</p>
    <p><br>None of them were conducted with regards to financial surveillance laws. It means that nobody has ever assessed if any of the previous iteration was actually effective, nor if the proposed dispositions will ever be, nor if they would jeopardize Human Rights for European citizens.</p>
    <p><br>Rights to self-determination, dignity, resistance to oppression… all these rights are currently being trumped by the EU’s AML laws. The presumption of innocence – a pillar of democracy – is reversed, as all EU residents are presumed criminals and surveilled upon, even before behaving in a suspicious way, while surveillance is handed over to private financial institutions, with little to no judicial oversight. All these aspects are contrary to the EUCFR and the ECHR as ruled by the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. As a whole, the AML Laws body is also contradictory to the GDPR, setting up data exploitation and requirements that are not compatible with the respect of data privacy, the right to be forgotten, and transparency concerning data processing. As recognised by the European Court of Human Rights, without privacy, there can be no freedom.</p>
    <p><br>Right to property is starting to be questioned, since citizens are now expected to justify to an authority for any spending they make with money they’ve earned. </p>
    <p><br>According to the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice, the principles of necessity and proportionnality require that the need for any interference with human rights are convincingly established and that the impacts on individuals’ rights and freedoms are not going further than needed to fulfil the legitimate aim being pursued. This implies both that the impacts of the interference be reduced to the minimum possible and that, once this minimisation has taken place, the remaining impacts not exceed the benefits of the interference for society.</p>
    <p><br>Since no impact or Human Rights studies were conducted before the European Parliament’s passing of the new AMLR6 and AMLA, and in light of the fact that the efficiency of AML laws has never been demonstrated – while the risks on Human Rights are real, and no safeguards for protection are set up – the EU’s AML laws do not respect the principle of necessity and proportionality, which are mandatory requirements to be demonstrated bythe European Union.</p>
    <p><br>The EU’s AML laws are not only proven to be ineffective, but demonstratively put citizens at risk by imposing gigantic personal data collection by private entities, in a time where hacks are getting more frequent, and AI/ML technologies can quickly transform very little information into dangerous decision processes impacting our daily lives.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h2><br>The Right to a Private Life</h2>
    <p><br>Any collection of or access to a private information is an interference and a distinct one, “no matter whether the information on the private lives concerned is sensitive or whether the persons concerned have been inconvenienced in any way” [4]. States are not only compelled to abstain from arbitrary interference, but also to adopt measures designed to secure respect for private life, even in the sphere of the relations of individuals [5] and private parties [6] between themselves.</p>
    <p><br>An interference is legitimate (i.e. it does not breach art. 8 of the ECHR) where, in order to pursue a legitimate aim, it is appropriate to answer a “pressing social need” [7], and it is proportionate to this need. “Appropriate to answer a pressing social need” means in particular that it “must be supported by sufficient evidence” [8] that the interference may effectively mitigate the harm caused to society [9]. More globally, the need must be “convincingly established” [10] by the State [11].</p>
    <p><br>In relation to this necessity test, the Art. 29 Working Party, in the light of ECtHR court-cases, highlighted those possible factors: [12] Is the measure seeking to address an issue which, if left unaddressed, may result in harm to or have some detrimental effect on society or a section of society? Is there any evidence that the measure may mitigate such harm? What is the effectiveness of existing measures? Why are they no longer sufficient for meeting the need? (“it must be clearly demonstrable how the proposed measure will address the pressing social need identified backed up by evidence”) [13] What are the broader views (societal, historic or political etc) of society on the issue in question? Have any specific views/opposition to a measure or issue expressed by society been sufficiently taken into account?</p>
    <p><br>Proportionality includes the minimisation of the interference, which must not go "further than needed to fulfil the legitimate aim being pursued" [14]. This implies both that the impacts of the interference be reduced to the minimum possible and that, once this minimisation has taken place, the remaining impacts not exceed the benefits of the interference for society [15]. In particular, the interference must be reduced to the strict necessary in relation to the following elements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The number of personal information stored, the time during which they will be processed1, the number of places and of people affected2. Especially, data retention cannot be of « indiscriminate nature » before any suspicion that an offence has been commited [16], and in case of a suspicion, “irrespective of the nature or gravity of the offence with which the individual was originally suspected” [17].</li>
        <br>
        <li>the cases of exercise of the measure, and the time during which the measure will be effective1. The ECtHR also verifies if the aim of the interference “can be satisfactorily addressed in some other, less restrictive way” [18]. Consequently, the ECtHR considers that "an explanation of what other measures were considered and whether or not these were found to be more or less privacy-intrusive” should have been presented, and “if any were rejected which were found to be less privacy-intrusive, then the strong justifying reasons as to why this measure was not the one that was selected to be implemented should [have been] given" [19].</li>
    </ul>

    <p><br>Proportionnality also implies that “there exist adequate and effective guarantees against abuse” [20], “including the possibility of an effective control of the measure at issue” [21]. The quality of the parliamentary and judicial review is of particular importance in view of ensuring that “a fair balance has been struck between the competing interests of the State or the public generally and those directly affected by the legislative choices” [22].</p>
    <p><br>“The need for such safeguards is all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned, not least when such data are used for police purposes”. These guarantees must be provided for by domestic law and must be “adequate” to ensure that “retained personal data [are] efficiently protected from misuse and abuse”1. They must include “independent review of the justification for the retention according to defined criteria, including such factors as the seriousness of the offence, previous arrests, the strength of the suspicion against the person and any other special circumstances” [23].</p>
    <p><br>Finally, the interference with the right to private life must also be taken “in accordance with the law”, which inter alia means that the law must “be adequately accessible and foreseeable, that is, formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual - if need be with appropriate advice - to regulate his conduct. If it is to be deemed consonant with those requirements, the law must indicate the scope of any powers [and of discretion [24]] conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of their exercise with sufficient clarity to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference”[25].</p>
    <h2><br>Threats to Democracy</h2>
    <p><br>Arbitrary limitations of private life may limit individuals’ “personal development"1, whether in terms of personality or of “personal autonomy”2, as well as the right "to establish and develop relationships with other human beings"3 and “the outside world”4, which amounts to the right to a “private social life”5 and self-determination6, and which implies the absence of “outside interference”7.</p>
    <p><br>The right to self-determination is of utmost importance since it might be considered  “as a tool for guaranteeing the democratic functioning of society”1 since it is “a precondition to real democratic discussion”1. Authors of these formula refer to a decision of the German Supreme Court from 1983, which declared unconstitutional certain provisions of a law that was granting the government with powers in terms of personal data collection for statistical purposes2. Ruling on the principle of dignity and the principle of self-development, which are both enshrined in the German Constitution3, the Supreme Court stated that processing possibilities, including unlimited storage and retrieval capabilities as well as creation of profiles through databases interconnections, undermine the dignity and right to self-development of individuals where these persons have “no sufficient means of controlling its truth and application” which lead to possibilities “of inspection and of gaining influence” which may “influence the individual’s behaviour by the psychological pressure exerted by public interests”, which in turns impacts the individual’s “chances of development” and “the common good (“Gemeinwohl”), because self-determination is an elementary functional condition of a free democratic society based on its citizens’ capacity to act and to cooperate”4. In the same line, “those who count with the possibility that their presence at a meeting or participation in a civil initiation be registered by the authority will be incited to give up practising their basic rights (Basic Law, Art. 8 §. 9)” 5.</p>
    <p><br>The ECtHR, in the same line, stated that “contracting States [do not] enjoy an unlimited discretion to subject persons within their jurisdiction to secret surveillance. The Court, being aware of the danger such a law poses of undermining or even destroying democracy on the ground of defending it, affirms that the Contracting States may not, in the name of the struggle against espionage and terrorism, adopt whatever measures they deem appropriate.”1</p>
    <h2><br>Threats to the Right to Resist Oppression</h2>
    <p><br>The right of resistance to oppression, in the meaning of resistance to a tyrannical regime, does not appear in the ECHR and in the EUCFR, nor in most other international treaties1, whereas it is not uncommon in national Constitutions2. This seems to be a consequence of the fact that these treaties organise a system in which such a right does not have a proper place.</p>
    <p><br>Indeed, the European Convention on Human Rights organises the protection of fundamental rights, which are supposed to be enforced by domestic courts under its supervision in last resort1. In addition, the preamble of the Convention engages States to ensure “an effective political democracy” as the best instrument to maintain fundamental freedoms. Therefore, the right to resist oppression applies where democracy and judicial remedies are not effective. In other words, it applies when the Convention is not respected at its foundations – and further not applicable anymore based on the choice, implicit or explicit, of a state. As an author stated, “it is difficult to imagine that the law may establish a rule that might contribute to weaken its very foundations”2, or that might result in an admission of failure of the fundamental rights protection mechanisms it established3.</p>
    <p><br>This being said, several authors identify a right of resistance to oppression as a general principle of international law1, based on a “right to democracy”, being itself an “internal component” of a right to self-determination2 which is read in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 19483. This appears absolutely consistent with the principles of dignity and of self-determination that are protected against any interference by the ECtHR, since the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 inspired the writers of the ECHR1, which itself refers to the Declaration in its Preamble. This is also in line with authors, such as Paul De Hert and Serge Gutwirth, who base the right to resist oppression on the right to privacy, which in turns guarantees the “freedom to self-determination” and “each person’s uniqueness, including alternative behaviour and the resistance to power at a time when it clashes with other interests or with the public interest” 2</p>
    <p><br>Where a right is restricted in a manner that individuals may not anymore exercise a right with a minimum of confidentiality, this may generate “the collapse, in the future, of any possibility of effective exercise of the fundamental right to resist oppression, corollary to individual freedom itself1”. This was highlighted by one hundred and twenty French members of the Parliament in the context of an attempt by the French State to create, in 2012, a biometric identity card, which was qualified as “the file of honest people”2. Despite this opposition, the database was established in 2016, by means of a decree.</p>
    <p><br>The preservation of the practical possibility to resist oppression is of utmost importance. This preservation makes it possible to choose liberal democracy as a political system, “not only from Law, which, instead of guaranteeing rights and protecting freedoms, manifestly breaches them, but also from the system which enables that such laws might be issued”1.</p>
    <p><br>To illustrate this crucial need, we can cite Raymond Forni, once Vice-President of the French Data Protection Authority and President of the French National Assembly1:</p>
    <p class="quote"><br>“In a democracy, I think that it is necessary that there exists a room for fraud. If false identity cards could not have been manufactured during the war, tens of thousands of men and women would have been arrested, deported, undoubtedly dead. [Without such a room] there is no real democracy”.</p>
    <p><br>Disappearance of the practical possibility to exercise the right to resist oppression is not acceptable in a democracy governed by the rule of law. In essence, such disappearance means that liberal democracy itself has already disappeared. It means that the core of fundamental rights, including the right to dignity and to self-determination, themselves disappeared – based on the denial of the democratic constitutive elements that are the requirements for necessity and proportionality of any limitation of right.</p>
    <p><br>Actually, the possibility for financial and banking stakeholders and even States to, systematically, identify all the financial transactions of any individual, in an indiscrimnate manner, and even to prevent a transaction from being processed, already constitutes a great threat to the right to resist oppression. Together with the possibility to locate individuals according to the place they use their funds, it leads, in practice, to the suppression of the very possibility to resist in case one of these stakeholders would decide to prevent someone to access his or her funds, in particular where unsufficient safeguards do not guarantee against an arbitrary decision in the field.</p>
    <h2><br>Application to AML Laws</h2>
    <p><br>Globally, in the light of the ECtHR and the EUCJ court cases, a large range of provisions of AML laws appear to not be “necessary in a democratic society”, which is required by the ECHR and the EUCFR and which is binding for States and the EU, negatively (they must respect this requirement in the acts they adopt) and positively (they must adopt provisions in order to ensure that this requirement is applied by private parties such as banks).</p>
    <p><br>Firstly, their necessity or need has not been demonstrated, both in terms (1) of money laundering (ML) and terrorism funding (TF) effective cases linked to all assets and transactions of which the use, exercise or confidentiality is restricted, and (2) of accuracy to effectively reduce demonstrated ML or TF cases.</p>
    <p><br>Secondly, their proportionnality has not been ensured, since restrictions on confidentiality and usage (1) are going further than needed to reach their aim (impacts on individuals are much more importants than the results that seem to be obtained in the area of fighting ML and TF), (2) are not justified in the light of results obtained on ML and FT within the framework of previous legislation, and (3) are not surrounded by adequate and effective guarantees against abuse, such as the precise definition of the scope of any powers and of any discretion conferred on the competent authorities and stakeholders including banks, and the manner of their exercise, an independent survervision and effective legal remedies. This, while it has been ruled that the need for such safeguards is all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned.</p>
    <p><br>In addition, general and indiscriminate surveillance and restriction of use, concerning all citizens and all operations, in a given area, without even be limitated to cases where the commission of an offence is suspected, has been ruled as threatening the democracy itself, as well as self determination, dignity and the right to resist oppression, which is not acceptable in a democratic society. This is even worsened by the detrimental effect of AML provisions that impose generalised and indiscriminate kyc, in a context where personal data leaks happen daily, factually, which leads to force citizens to reveal very personal information that will surely, in a more or less short term, be stolen and used by criminals.  </p>
